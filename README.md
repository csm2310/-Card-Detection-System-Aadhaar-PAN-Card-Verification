Overview

The Identity Card Detection System is an Android application that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect and extract text from identity cards. Originally developed as a JavaScript-based web application, this system has been successfully converted into an Android app using Android Studio.

Features

Real-time identity card detection using the device camera

OCR-based text extraction from ID cards

Automatic cropping and preprocessing for better accuracy

User-friendly interface with simple navigation

Technologies Used

Android Studio for application development

Java/Kotlin as the programming language

Tesseract OCR or Google ML Kit for text extraction

OpenCV (optional) for image preprocessing

XML for UI design
